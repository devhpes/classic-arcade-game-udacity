# How To Play 

The goal of the player is to reach the water without colliding into the bugs. You can use left, right, up and down keys to prevent the colliding.

If the player collides with the enemy bugs, the game will reset and the player will get automatically to their initial position.

Once the player reaches the water, the game is won.
